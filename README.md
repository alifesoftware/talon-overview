# Talon Help

This is a fork of my [help-site-template](https://github.com/klinker24/help-site-template). It serves two purposes for [Talon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.twitter_l):

1. It will host the help topics for the app. This includes feature descriptions, common questions, limitations, and anything else that people reach out to me about.
2. It will host the overview page for the app. This will just be a static page that displays some features, has some screenshots, and links to some information.
3. It will host the privacy policy for the app.

To learn more about creating your own help page, based on my template, please see the [help-site-template](https://github.com/klinker24/help-site-template) repository.
